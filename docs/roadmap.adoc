Our vision for uncontained.io guides is to provide a jumping off point
for individuals, communities, and companies to sustainably embrace
containers and related container technologies as well as industry best
practices.

[[cy-2017]]
=== CY 2017

We started by focusing on open source containers, because they play a
critical role in growing healthy cloud projects. Creators help set good
examples for contributors and consumers of container technologies. We
also noticed there were very few good comprehensive resources aimed at
helping creators and consumers to effectively utilize containers.

* [x] Create a first set of guides that help creators start and use
their own open source containers
* [x] Make the guides public and release it as an open source project
* [x] Expand https://github.com/redhat-cop/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing
to uncontained.io on GitHub] to include community best practices for
contributors.
* [ ] Foster healthy community dynamics so the guides become a place to
codify community best practices
