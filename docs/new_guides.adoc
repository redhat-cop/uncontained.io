Proposing a new guide
---------------------

Thanks for your interest in suggesting a new uncontained.io guide! Your
suggestions help us decide what to work on next.

[[if-youd-like-to-propose-a-new-guide]]
If youâ€™d like to propose a new guide:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  *https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/issues[Open an issue]*
with your suggestion. Please explain:

* Why the topic is broadly useful to uncontained.io contributors
* Why it doesnâ€™t fit into an existing guide
* 3-5 bullets of expected sub-topics

1.  We (likely @jaredburck, @etsauer, or @sabre1041) will label the
issue `new-guide` and share feedback.

At this point, we may decide the topic doesnâ€™t warrant a new guide and
close the issue, or we may recommend adding the information to an
existing guide. Thatâ€™s okay! All suggestions are welcomed contributions,
because they help us understand what our community is thinking.
