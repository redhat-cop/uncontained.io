= Local Developer Image for Uncontained.io

The local developer docker image provides a container image with all of the tooling needed for a contributor to build and run Uncontained.io locally. Generally, a contributor should not need to build this image themselves, as it is automatically built and pushed to link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev[quay.io]. Information on the usage of the image for local dev can be found in our link:/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contribution guide].

If you are working on improvements to the image however, you can build it locally with:

[source,bash]
----
cd uncontained.io/
buildah bud -f container-images/local-dev/Dockerfile -t uncontained-local-dev .
----


To run the image you can use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 uncontained-local-dev
----

This command will run uncontained.io usin embedded copy of the source code.


If you need to run it with actual code use this:

[source,bash]
----
podman run -u $(id -u) -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 uncontained-local-dev
----

After this uncontained.io will be available locally via http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3001 for Browsersync.
