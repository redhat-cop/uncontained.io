This is the source code repository for
http://uncontained.io/[Uncontained.io], a site that focuses on
Containers, Cloud, and Digital Transformation guidance for the
Enterprise.

== Background

The first sets of uncontained.io guides were created and curated by Red
Hat Consultants, along with input from outside community reviewers, but
they are not exclusive to Red Hat products.

Our goal is to aggregate community best practices, _not_ what Red Hat
(or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we try to
use examples and quotations from the field or others to illustrate our
points.

*Uncontained.io is a community resource.* One reason we started this
project is because we felt that there weren’t enough really good
resources for organizations creating and using DevOps-centric tooling &
tech. We made these guides open source in hopes that you’ll use this
space to talk about best practices, then document them when you’ve found
consensus. We’d like this to be a safe space to talk about what’s hard,
what’s scary, and what’s simply confusing about running and using
containers & cloud technologies.

== Roadmap

We’ve shared our vision and priorities for this project in our
link:docs/roadmap.adoc[roadmap].

== Contributing

This site is powered by https://gohugo.io/[Hugo]. Our goal is for this
project to reflect community best practices, so we’d love your input!
