Uncontained.io theme
--------------------

Based on the http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/blank/[Blank starter theme]

[[developing]]
Developing
~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions in
https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#setting-up-your-environment[setting
up your environment] to get up and running with Hugo and the tools we
use to build uncontained.io.

In the root of this repository, run `hugo serve -D --noHTTPCache` to
start the Hugo server.

Then, go to `themes/uncontained.io` and run these commands:

....
npm install
npm run watch
....

Now, when you edit a file in `src`, the following will happen:

1.  Gulp will see that a file has changed
2.  Gulp will compile the source files and output the results to
`static/dist`
3.  Hugo will see that files in `static` have changed
4.  Hugo will auto-reload the page in your browser.

Building
~~~~~~~~

To build the site:

....
cd themes/uncontained.io
npm run build
cd ../..
hugo
....

[[css-framework]]
CSS Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are using a pared-down version of https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap
4], customized as per the
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/[theming
instructions]. We’ve left out parts of Bootstrap CSS and all of
Bootstrap JS. To see which Bootstrap modules we’re using, see
`style.scss`. To see all of the Bootstrap modules that exist, see
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/bootstrap.scss[bootstrap.scss].

[[sasscss-code-standards]]
Sass/CSS Code Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In lieu of formal code standards, here are some general guidelines:

* Minimize selector specificity.
* Use simple, meaningful CSS class names. Use only lowercase letters and
dashes (no underscores, double dashes, etc.).
* Use variables for colors and font names.
* Prefer removing styles to overriding them.
* Prefer configuring the framework to overriding it.
