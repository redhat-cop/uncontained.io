:toc-placement!:

Thanks for checking out the uncontained.io guides! We’re excited to hear
and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others who read and
use these guides.

We’ve put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where
you can best be helpful.

== Types of contributions we’re looking for

This project is an attempt at establish and document some guiding
principles and, dare we say it, best practices in the open source
emerging technology space. Currently that space, as we see it, is
predominantly made up of technologies that enable DevOps practices, such
as ``Cloud'' (API-automated Infrastructure), CI/CD tooling, container
technologies, microservices frameworks, and probably more. This project
was started by a community of thought leaders from Red Hat so if it
initially appears as if this site is only about Red Hat technologies,
it’s not intended to be, its just impassioned people writing about what
they know.

There are also many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in
descending order of need):

* Fix editorial inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or stale content
* Add tutorials, examples, or anecdotes that help illustrate a point
* Revise language to be more approachable and friendly
* Propose a new guide (link:./docs/new_articles.adoc[here’s how])

Interested in making a contribution? Read on!

== Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and
that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We
all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely
have different perspectives on "how open source is done". Try to
listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Uncontained.io guides are released with a
link:./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Contributor Code of Conduct]. By participating
in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution
passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address
them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please
don’t add references or links to things you or your employer have
created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

== Getting set up for local development

Before you begin contributing, its important to get your local machine set up to run and test the site. For convenience, we provide a link:container-images/local-dev/[container image] that contains all of the development tools. The simplest way to run the image is as follows:

----
podman run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev
----

Or, if you use Docker:
----
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev
----

This will run uncontained.io from an embedded copy of the source code baked into the image.

=== Building and Developing the Site

Uncontained.io uses the https://gohugo.io/[Hugo static site generator]
to translate Asciidoc into an HTML site. We wrap this functionality in
https://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] to streamline the build and test process.
Familiarity with Gulp and https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] is expected if you want to be able to change the functionality of the build. Our Hugo + Gulp setup is based on the
https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo[victor-hugo] boilerplate.

If you are only interested in developing content, however, all you need is familiarity with link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Writing AsciiDoc].

All you need to get set up is to clone the repository.

----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io.git
cd uncontained.io/
----

=== Running the Live Preview

The live preview provides an embedded server in which you can test the
site locally, and watch changes being made as you develop. You can start the server, running from your local copy of the code using the container image:

----
podman run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev
----

Or, if you use Docker:
----
docker run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev
----

The container also accepts extra arguments which it feeds to `npm`. For example, if you’d like to also include _draft_ content like
`hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture`, we've created a script entry in our package.json for that:

----
podman run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  run start-preview
----

Or, if you use Docker:
----
docker run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  run start-preview
----

You should be able to view the site by browsing to
http://localhost:3000/.

To open Browsersync browse to
http://localhost:3001/.


=== Building the Site

The site build will simple generate all of the site html, css,
javascript, etc. This is the process we use to build and publish the
site.

----
podman run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  run build
----

Or, if you use Docker:
----
docker run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  run build
----

=== Running the Automated Tests

In order to validate that changes you've made haven't led to any unforeseen issues, you can use
the container image to run our automated tests.

----
podman run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  test
----

Or, if you use Docker:
----
docker run -u $(id -u) \
  -v ${PWD}:/uncontained.io:Z -it \
  quay.io/redhat-cop/uncontained-local-dev \
  test
----


=== Deploying to OpenShift (testing only)

The Uncontained.io Jenkins pipeline can be deployed and used purely for testing purposes. Our pipeline can be deployed to any OpenShift cluster, and is automated using link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier[OpenShift Applier]. The following commands can be used to install Applier, log in to your OpenShift cluster, and deploy the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p galaxy
oc login ...
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml
----

This will result in the creation of a pipeline and deployment environments across several project:

* `uncontained` is where the link:.openshift/templates/build.yml[Jenkins Pipeline] will be deployed to.
* `uncontained-dev` will be used as the Development environment, where smoke tests are run.
* `uncontained-test` and `uncontained-stage` are both promotion environments

If you need to customize the deployment (e.g. for testing a Pull Request), the Applier inventory supports a number of parameters to customize the deployment. The following command is an example of configuring the pipeline to build from an alternative fork and branch. For other possible parameters, see link:.applier/group_vars/all.yml[all.yml].

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e source_repo=https://github.com/etsauer/uncontained.io.git -e source_ref=feature-123
----

=== Deploying to OpenShift (production process)

Uncontained.io is built and hosted on OpenShift, and deployed using
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier[OpenShift Applier]

Run the following to pull in applier:

----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p galaxy
----

Log into your _Prod_ OpenShift cluster, and run the following command.

----
$ oc login <prod cluster> ...
$ ansible-playbook -i .applier-prod/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml
----

One of the things that was created by ansible is a `ServiceAccount` that
will be used for promoting your app from _Dev_ to _Prod_. We’ll need to
extract its credentials so that our pipeline can use that account.

----
$ TOKEN=$(oc serviceaccounts get-token promoter -n field-guides-prod)
----

We need to create the the _prod-api-credentials_ param file so our
pipeline will be able to verify a successful deployment to production.

----
$ echo "TOKEN=${TOKEN}
API_URL=<API_URL>
REGISTRY_URL=<REGISTRY URL>
SECRET_NAME=other-cluster-credentials" > .openshift/params/prod-cluster-credentials
----

Now, deploy your pipeline and dev environment to your _development_ cluster:

----
oc login <dev cluster>
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e filter_tags=staging,prod
----

== Contributing Content

If you’d like to contribute, start by searching through the GitHub
https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/issues[issues] and
https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/pulls[pull requests] to see
whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don’t see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals
of this guide, do one of the following: * *If your contribution is
minor,* such as a typo fix, open a pull request. * *If your contribution
is major,* such as a new article or category, start by opening an issue
first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
do any work.

=== Contributing a new article

See our guide on link:./docs/new_articles.adoc[contributing new content].

=== Migrating Content from OpenShift-Playbooks

This site is the evolution of the
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-playbooks[OpenShift Playbooks]
site.

Migrating content from there to here is fairly straightforward, but
involves some work.

1.  A migration script can be used to translate documents from the
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-playbooks[openshift-playbooks]
repo.
+
Usage: `./migrate-doc.sh [path/playbook-doc] [path/uncontained-doc]`
+
Example:
`./migrate-doc.sh continuous_delivery/external-jenkins-integration.adoc articles/external-jenkins-integration.adoc`
2.  Next, start the test site using the
link:#containerized-hugo-environment-quickstart-guide[container image]
or link:#native-hugo-environment-quickstart-guide[native hugo].
3.  Navigate to the content you migrated and ensure that:

* all content renders correctly
* there are no broken links (we recommend using a link checker like
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkchecker/[this one for
Firefox] or
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/broken-link-checker/nibppfobembgfmejpjaaeocbogeonhch?hl=en[this
one for Chrome])
* if the guide or article links to other guides, or articles, we suggest
you migrate those as well.

1.  Examine front matter. Ensure `title` is reader friendly, and that
the `date` represents the date written, not the date migrated.

=== Helping us with Site Styling, User Experience, etc.

The styling for the site is contained within a
https://gohugo.io/themes/[Hugo Theme]. The source code for the theme is
located in this repo at ./site/themes/uncontained.io.

Specifically, the code for our HTML Layouts can be found in
./site/themes/uncontained.io/layouts/. The CSS code can be found in
link:./site/themes/uncontained.io/src/scss/[./site/themes/uncontained.io/src/scss].

See link:#building-and-developing-the-site[Building and Developing the
site] for instructions on how to perform local testing of changes.

== Style guide

This site is written in asciidoc format and is built using
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. If you’re writing content, see
the link:./docs/style_guide.adoc[style guide] to help your prose match
the rest of the Guides.
