[[types-of-contributions-were-looking-for]]
== Types of contributions we’re looking for

This project is an attempt at establish and document some guiding
principles and, dare we say it, best practices in the open source
emerging technology space. Currently that space, as we see it, is
predominantly made up of technologies that enable DevOps practices, such
as ``Cloud'' (API-automated Infrastructure), CI/CD tooling, container
technologies, microservices frameworks, and probably more. This project
was started by a community of thought leaders from Red Hat so if it
initially appears as if this site is only about Red Hat technologies,
it’s not intended to be, its just impassioned people writing about what
they know.

There are also many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in
descending order of need):

* Fix editorial inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or stale content
* Add tutorials, examples, or anecdotes that help illustrate a point
* Revise language to be more approachable and friendly
* Propose a new guide (link:./docs/new_guides.md[here’s how])

[[ground-rules-expectations]]
== Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and
that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We
all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely
have different perspectives on ``how open source is done.'' Try to
listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Uncontained.io guides are released with a
link:./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Contributor Code of Conduct]. By participating
in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution
passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address
them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please
don’t add references or links to things you or your employer have
created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

[[how-to-contribute]]
== How to contribute

If you’d like to contribute, start by searching through the GitHub
https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/issues[issues],
https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io/pulls[pull requests], and
Trello https://trello.com/b/JMaxIjCy/cant-contain-this[cards] to see
whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don’t see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals
of this guide, do one of the following: * *If your contribution is
minor,* such as a typo fix, open a pull request. * *If your contribution
is major,* such as a new article or category, start by opening an issue
first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
do any work.

[[style-guide]]
== Style guide

This site is written in asciidoc format and is built using
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. If you’re writing content, see
the link:./docs/style_guide.adoc[style guide] to help your prose match
the rest of the Guides.

[[setting-up-your-environment]]
== Setting up your environment

This site is powered by https://gohugo.io/[Hugo]. Running it on your
local machine only requires a working
https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing[Hugo] installation, either
natively or a docker container. We recommend using the docker container
method (for obvious reasons) instead of your native operating system,
but you may choose either environment setup.

[[building-and-developing-the-site]]
=== Building and Developing the Site

Uncontained.io uses the https://gohugo.io/[Hugo static site generator]
to translate Asciidoc into an HTML site. We wrap this functionality in
https://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] to streamline the build and test process.
Running the site requires https://nodejs.org/[Node.js]. Once installed,
you should have all you need to build, test and develop. To get started,
set up your local environment.

....
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/uncontained.io.git
cd uncontained.io/
npm install
....

Our Hugo + Gulp setup is based on the
https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo[victor-hugo] boilerplate.

[[run-the-live-preview]]
==== Run the Live Preview

The live preview provides an embedded server in which you can test the
site locally, and watch changes being made as you develop.

....
npm start
....

or, if you’d like to also include _draft_ content like
`hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture`:

....
npm run start-preview
....

You should be able to view the site by browsing to
http://localhost:3000/.

[[build-the-site]]
==== Build the Site

The site build will simple generate all of the site html, css,
javascript, etc. This is the process we use to build and publish the
site.

....
npm run build
....

[[deploying-to-openshift]]
==== Deploying to OpenShift

Uncontained.io is built and hosted on OpenShift, and deployed using
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier[OpenShift Applier]

Run the following to pull in applier:

....
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p galaxy
....

To deploy to a _development_ cluster, run:

....
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml
....

To deploy to managed prototype environment, run:

....
ansible-playbook -i .applier/ galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e filter_tags=prototype
....

[[migrating-content-from-openshift-playbooks]]
=== Migrating Content from OpenShift-Playbooks

This site is the evolution of the
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-playbooks[Openshift Playbooks]
site.

Migrating content from there to here is fairly straightforward, but
involves some work.

1.  A migration script can be used to translate documents from the
https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-playbooks[openshift-playbooks]
repo.
+
Usage: `./migrate-doc.sh [path/playbook-doc] [path/uncontained-doc]`
+
Example:
`./migrate-doc.sh continuous_delivery/external-jenkins-integration.adoc guides/external-jenkins-integration.adoc`
2.  Next, start the test site using the
link:#containerized-hugo-environment-quickstart-guide[container image]
or link:#native-hugo-environment-quickstart-guide[native hugo]
3.  Navigate to the content you migrated and ensure that:

* all content renders correctly
* there are no broken links (we recommend using a link checker like
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkchecker/[this one for
Firefox] or
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/broken-link-checker/nibppfobembgfmejpjaaeocbogeonhch?hl=en[this
one for Chrome])
* if the guide or article links to other guides, or articles, we suggest
you migrate those as well.

1.  Examine front matter. Ensure `title` is reader friendly, and that
the `date` represents the date written, not the date migrated.
