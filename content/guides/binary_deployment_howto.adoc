Here I am going to walk through the steps to do a simple binary deployment to Tomcat 8 in OpenShift Container Platform. What you need to follow along are:

- A WAR file
- An OpenShift Environment running 3.1.1 or later
- The `oc` (OpenShift Client) utility. link:{docs_url}cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[Install Instructions here].

== Local Setup

Here I have a local directory called `warfile-demo` that just contains my warfile:

[sourc,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost ~]$ cd warfile-demo/
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ ls
ticket-monster.war
----

This war file is a jboss-demo sample app we like to use a lot. It would pulled and built from link:https://github.com/jboss-developer/ticket-monster[GitHub].

In order to simplify the URL structure for my application, I'm going to rename my warfile to `ROOT.war`.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ mv ticket-monster.war ROOT.war
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ ls
ROOT.war
----

Now, when I deploy to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/single/red-hat-xpaas-jboss-web-server-image/[OpenShift Tomcat 8 Image], it's going to expect my warfile to be in a `deployments` directory, so I'm going to do that as well.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ mkdir deployments
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ mv ROOT.war deployments/
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ ls
deployments
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ ls deployments/
ROOT.war
----

== OpenShift Setup

Next I'm going to log into OpenShift and setup a project to build and run my app in.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc login --server master.d2.rhc-ose.labs.redhat.com:8443 -u esauer
Authentication required for https://master.d2.rhc-ose.labs.redhat.com:8443 (openshift)
Username: esauer
Password:
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * validate (current)

Using project "validate".
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc new-project warfile-demo
Now using project "warfile-demo" on server "https://master.d2.rhc-ose.labs.redhat.com:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git

to build a new hello-world application in Ruby.
----

== Building and Deploying the App

Now, I'm about ready to deploy my app. A Binary Deployment in OpenShift consists of two phases:

- A Build: I push my binary (WAR file) up to OpenShift, and it builds a new image around my app.
- A Deployment: OpenShift Instantiates the image it just build to create a new container running my app.

=== Creating the Build

So for the build step, I require a few things:

- My local WAR file
- The name of the link:{docs_url}architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[ImageStream] for the image I want to deploy to. In this case, tomact 8.

Since I already have my WAR file ready, I just need to find the right ImageStream to use. By default, OpenShift stores all of it's ImageStreams in a globally readable project called `openshift`, so I'll just do a search there for `tomcat8`.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc get imagestream -n openshift | grep tomcat8
jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift   registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/webserver30-tomcat8-openshift     1.1-3,1.1-7,1.2 + 2 more...        5 weeks ago
----

Now I can take that ImageStream name and plug it into a new build. I'm going to give the build a name of `ticket-monster`:

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc new-build jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift --name=ticket-monster --binary=true
--> Found image 298446b (11 weeks old) in image stream "jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift" in project "openshift" under tag "latest" for "jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift"

    JBoss Web Server 3.0
    --------------------
    Platform for building and running web applications on JBoss Web Server 3.0 - Tomcat v8

    Tags: builder, java, tomcat8

    * A source build using binary input will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "ticket-monster:latest"

--> Creating resources with label build=ticket-monster ...
    imagestream "ticket-monster" created
    buildconfig "ticket-monster" created
--> Success
----

Notice what OpenShift did with my request... It created me an `imagestream` and a `buildconfig` object, both named `ticket-monster`. The `imagestream` will track the new images that get built as part of this new build process, and the `buildconfig` contains all the instructions that tell OpenShift how to build my app.

Now I can kick off my build by pointing the `oc` client at my local project directory. The command to do that is `oc start-build <buildconfig-name> --from-dir=<dir-path>`. Before I run it though, I want to walk through a few parameters I'm going to use. First off, I know that my `<buildconfig-name>` will be `ticket-monster` and the `<file-path>` will be my current `warfile-demo` directory. If I run that command as-is (i.e. `oc start-build ticket-monster --from-dir=.`) then a build will kick-off, the command will exit, and the build will run in the background. However, in this instance, I would prefer to actually follow the status of the build. To do that, I'm going to add the `--follow=true` (follow the logs of the build) and `--wait=true` (wait until the build completes to return an exit code).

----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc start-build ticket-monster --from-dir=. --follow=true --wait=true
Uploading "." at commit "HEAD" as binary input for the build ...
Uploading directory "." as binary input for the build ...

----

The final line of the log before the build completes should be `Successfully pushed 172.30.51.200:5000/warfile-demo/ticket-monster:latest`. This confirms that I now have a built application image in OpenShift's registry ready to deploy.

=== Creating the Deployment

Now that I have my application image built, I can deploy it. This is very simple. I just run the `oc new-app` command and specify my ImageStream, `ticket-monster`.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc new-app ticket-monster
--> Found image 1a26477 (25 minutes old) in image stream ticket-monster under tag "latest" for "ticket-monster"

    warfile-demo/ticket-monster-2:25744ea1

    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "ticket-monster"
    * Ports 8080/tcp, 8443/tcp, 8778/tcp will be load balanced by service "ticket-monster"

--> Creating resources with label app=ticket-monster ...
    deploymentconfig "ticket-monster" created
    service "ticket-monster" created

    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

After a a minute or two, I will be able to see that I have a new pod running.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ticket-monster-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          41m
ticket-monster-1-t2wzk   1/1       Running     0          1m
ticket-monster-2-build   0/1       Completed   0          31m
----

Additionlly, when we ran `oc new-app` a service was also created, and we can see that as well:
[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc get service
NAME             CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
ticket-monster   172.30.62.188   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP,8778/TCP   9m
----

Note that the `CLUSTER-IP` field contains a Service IP address that is local only to machines within the OpenShift environment. In order to test my new app, I need to expose my service using a Route.

[source,bash]
----
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc expose service ticket-monster
route "ticket-monster" exposed
[esauer@localhost warfile-demo]$ oc get routes
NAME             HOST/PORT                                                                PATH      SERVICE                   TERMINATION   LABELS
ticket-monster   ticket-monster-warfile-demo.apps.d2.rhc-ose.labs.redhat.com ... 1 more             ticket-monster:8080-tcp                 app=ticket-monster
----

As you can see here, the `oc expose` command creates me a route with a hostname. This hostname is resolvable and accessible to me which means that I can now pull up `http://ticket-monster-warfile-demo.apps.d2.rhc-ose.labs.redhat.com` in my browser.
